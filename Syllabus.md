# C++ Programming Laboratory: Syllabus

## Policies

### On-Site Practice
- No cheating is allowed during practice sessions
- Students must follow the same rules and procedures as in CPE class
- All work must be completed individually during class time

### After-Class

Students are required to commit all on-site practice exercises to their personal course GitHub repository. Each submission must include a README.md file documenting the solutions and approaches used.

## Rubric
- **On-site practices** (40%)
    - Two on-site practices each week during class
    - Scoring per practice session:
        - Passed 2 problems: 100 points
        - Passed 1 problem: 70 points
        - Passed 0 problems: 0 points
    - The final on-site practice score is calculated from each student's top 20 practice scores
- **Midterm exam** (20%)
- **Final exam** (20%)
- **After class GitHub commit** (20%)
