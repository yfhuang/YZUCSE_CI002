# C++ Programming Laboratory Course

## Course Description   

This laboratory course focuses on developing practical C++ programming skills through intensive problem-solving practice. Students will work on carefully selected problems from UVa Online Judge and LeetCode platforms to strengthen their algorithmic thinking and coding proficiency. The primary objective is to prepare students for the Collegiate Programming Examination (CPE), equipping them with the necessary skills to analyze problems, design efficient solutions, and implement robust C++ code under time constraints.

## Importance

This course provides students with hands-on experience in a CPE-like environment, allowing them to practice coding exercises on-site. This simulated examination setting helps students become familiar with the testing conditions and builds confidence in solving problems under time pressure.
